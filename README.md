 - How to version?
   - Version up uses MASTER.MINOR.PATCH to specify each modification using the following the pattern x.x.x
 - How versions are controled?
   - MASTER: updated when you added features like new libs or more code to process the model in other ML algorithms
   - MINOR: updated when you improved some process in the code such as improvements in processing and new variatios of features to analyse.
   - PATCH: Small modifications in code, like fixes, performance improvements and code standardization.
