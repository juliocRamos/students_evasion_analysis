------- PRE_RELEASE VERSION CONTROL -------

current version:  0.6.0

Notes:

Pre-processing: Change rows by columns - DSC_MAT and DSC_STATUS_MAT

New pre-processing script: Transcription of Python code into R code

Pre-Processing: Improvements in pre-processing code to override NA
values with column media

Pre-Processing: Converted all *APROVADO or *REPROVADO column values
by 1 or 0 if NAN and dataset file format was converted from .xlsx
to .csv

Pre-Processing: Added R script into project pre_processing (fix OS
path imcompatibility) and implemented function to group and apply
mean function over column NOTA_MEDIA

Pre-processing: Added function to count and apply the retakes for
the appropriated lines. Solved some encoding comment errors and
removed code to handle incompatibility code.

Pre-processing: Changed discipline status to representative numbers 
and added the pivot_wider function to apply dataframe changes(create 
temp dataframe for transpose columns COD_MATERI and DSC_STATUS_MAT 
and merge students IDs).

Pre-processing: Fixed column means for NOTA_MEDIA and PONTUACAO_PS.

Pre-processing: General fixes and code refactoring.

Pre-processing: Added new columns: TOT_APROVACOES and TOT_MAT_CURSADAS.

Pre-analysis: Created r-script dropout_student_profile.r and graph plot 
(RESID_ARARAS only).

Pre-analysis: Created graphs for identification profile students (with 
BOLSISTA, RESID_ARARAS (changed for pie chart), EVADIDO and NOTA_MEDIA columns).

Pre-analysis: Created r-script dropout_student_profile.r and graph plot (RESID_ARARAS only)

Pre-processing: Added code to remove column "evasao_filtrado.RA"

Pre-processing: Changed year data filter to 2014; Fixed "APROVACOES|REPROVACOES" count function.
Abstracted count processing to independent function (reduced lines of code).
Exported new pre-processed file with modifications.

Pre-analysis: Fix filter methods (deleted count() functions - incompatibility R versions).

Pre-analysis: Created charts for student profile analyse and table to approved and disapproved 
means to year; standardizing plot charts.

Pre analysis: Fix chart "Top 10 Disciplinas mais cursadas (Aprovado x Reprovado)" and moved files
in correct folders.

Pre-processing: Created new columns TOT_REPROV_FREQ, TOT_REPROV_NOTA and TOT_REPROV_NOTA_FREQ.
Generated .arff database version.

Pre-processing: Implemented feature selection testing parts and removed low variation columns

Pre-processing: Fixed bug where the forward_stepwise filter was removing the EVADIDO column from final
exported file.

Pre-processing: Fixed Boruta bugs for generating filtered final dataset

Training models: Implemented KNN with scikit learn

Training models: Implemented test Neural Network with keras

Training models: Adapted Neural Network to run with TensorFlow.Keras

Pre-processing: Added label encodding for GRADE_CORRENTE

General: Removed unusefull files and datasets and improved .gitignore

Training Models: GridSearch and StratifiedKfold implementation to Decision
Tree algorithm and export results in CSV file (tests)

Training Models: Fix SVM and Decision Tree scripts and finish CSV export 
function

Training models: Standardized all training models and applied export_data_csv to knn and neural_network

General modifications: Removed unused files.

Pre-processing: Generated final trainig dbs.

Geleral modifications: Removed unused files; Updated project folder structure for original and
preprocessed dbs; Updated all load files paths in pre-processing and training.

Training models: Standardized Scaler for NeuralNetwork model and removed double call to scaler
from pipeline.

Training models: General code improvement

Training models: Adepted ML scripts for google colab tests executions.

Training models: Standardized parameters for all models

General modifications: Modified project strucutre to better split grid_search best param search
algorithms from train/test models and created scripts to test top 2 best grid_search params.
