path imcompatibility) and implemented function to group and apply
mean function over column NOTA_MEDIA

Pre-processing: Added function to count and apply the retakes for
the appropriated lines. Solved some encoding comment errors and
removed code to handle incompatibility code.

Pre-processing: Changed discipline status to representative numbers 
and added the pivot_wider function to apply dataframe changes(create 
temp dataframe for transpose columns COD_MATERI and DSC_STATUS_MAT 
and merge students IDs).

Pre-processing: Fixed column means for NOTA_MEDIA and PONTUACAO_PS.

Pre-processing: General fixes and code refactoring.

Pre-analysis: Created r-script dropout_student_profile.r and graph plot (RESID_ARARAS only)

Pre-processing: Added code to remove column "evasao_filtrado.RA"

Pre-processing: Changed year data filter to 2014; Fixed "APROVACOES|REPROVACOES" count function.
Abstracted count processing to independent function (reduced lines of code).
